# Product Guidelines

## Coding Standards & Conventions
- **Kotlin-First Approach:** Adhere to official Kotlin coding conventions to ensure idiomatic and maintainable code.
- **Modern Android Practices:** Implement architecture components (ViewModel, LiveData/Flow, Room) following the recommended "Guide to App Architecture."
- **Code Quality:** Prioritize readability and maintainability through consistent naming conventions and clear separation of concerns.

## UI/UX Guidelines
- **Material Design 3:** Strictly follow Material Design 3 (Material You) specifications for components, typography, and spacing.
- **Accessibility:** Ensure the application is accessible to all users by providing appropriate content descriptions, touch target sizes, and contrast ratios.
- **Visual Consistency:** Maintain a consistent aesthetic that aligns with the "Minimalist and Functional" design philosophy.

## Performance & Optimization
- **Responsiveness:** Ensure UI operations are performed off the main thread to prevent "Application Not Responding" (ANR) errors.
- **Resource Management:** Optimize images and other assets to minimize the application's memory and disk footprint.
- **Battery Efficiency:** Implement background tasks and network operations with battery life in mind (e.g., using WorkManager).

## Documentation
- **Clear Code Comments:** Use comments to explain the "why" behind complex logic.
- **Maintainable README:** Keep the project README updated with setup instructions and high-level architectural overview.
